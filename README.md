# Aldryon — A Text Based RPG

Aldryon is a text-based RPG built as a monorepo with a web front-end and an
API back-end.

## Gameplay

You fight monsters in turn-based battles. Both you and the monster have
**attributes**, which determine how much damage each attack deals. You also
have **HP** (health) and **Stamina** — attacks cost Stamina to perform.

On your turn, you choose one of:

- **Attack** — fight the monster, spending Stamina and dealing damage based
  on attributes.
- **Rest** — recover Stamina.
- **Bag** — use an item.
- **Run** — try to flee the battle; there's a chance the monster gets a free
  attack on you as you do.

Killing a monster grants **XP**. Enough XP levels you up, increasing your
attributes. The core risk: **if you die, you lose 1% of your XP.**

## Tech stack

- **Front-end** (`apps/web`) — [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (TypeScript),
  handles the UI and starts Google login via
  [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/auth).
- **Back-end** (`apps/api`) — [Bun](https://bun.sh/), built with
  **Clean Architecture + DDD** (`domain` → `usecase` → `interface`, with
  `infrastructure` implementing the boundaries). Verifies Google login via
  Supabase Auth and talks to **Postgres** (Supabase-hosted) directly.
- **Database & Auth** — [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Postgres + Google
  OAuth).
- **Shared contracts** (`apps/shared/dtos`) — Zod schemas shared between web
  and api.
- **Tooling** — [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) (lint + format), husky +
  lint-staged (pre-commit), [testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/)
  (integration tests), [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) (vulnerability scanning).
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions, deployed on [Render](https://render.com/).
